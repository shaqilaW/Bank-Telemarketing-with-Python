# Bank-Telemarketing-with-Python
Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset from a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaigns, which used phone calls to promote term deposit subscriptions. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer subscription and provide insights to optimize future campaigns.

The dataset contains information about:

Customer demographics (age, job, education, etc.)

Contact details (contact method, campaign duration, etc.)

Socioeconomic indicators (consumer price index, confidence index, etc.)

Subscription status (y - whether the customer subscribed or not)

##Key Objectives

Exploration: Identify customer segments most likely to subscribe.

Visualization: Use data visualization techniques to reveal trends.

Analysis: Determine the impact of different features on subscription probability.

##Tools & Libraries Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

Scikit-learn (Statistical analysis & modeling)

##How to Use

Open the Bank_Telemarketing.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells sequentially to process and analyze the data.

Modify parameters to experiment with different insights.
